# T1 — First HTML & CSS Application

**This is the first application in my "Zero Web School" series using HTML and CSS.**

---

## Project Location

`Self learning/Projects(CSS+HTML)/T1`

## Description

A simple beginner-friendly web page built to practice core HTML and CSS concepts. This project is the first in a series of small applications created as part of the Zero Web School learning path.

## Features

* Semantic HTML structure
* Responsive layout basics
* External CSS for styling
* Simple navigation/header and content sections

## How to run

1. Clone the repository (or download the folder).
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.

```bash
# Example (clone whole repo):
git clone https://github.com/amrkhaled104/frontend-learning-journey.git
cd frontend-learning-journey/Self\ learning/Projects(CSS+HTML)/T1
# then open index.html in your browser
```

## Notes

* This project is intentionally simple — the goal is to build a solid foundation in HTML and CSS before moving to more advanced topics.
* Future projects in the series will add interactivity and more complex layouts.
